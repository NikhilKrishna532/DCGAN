 # Synthetic-Human-Face-Generation-Using-Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-DCGAN

The project uses a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic human faces. By training the DCGAN on a dataset of real human faces, the model learns to create new, realistic faces that capture general human features without representing any specific individual.
