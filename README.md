# Synthetic Human Face Generation Using DCGAN

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a model using **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)** to generate realistic human faces. GANs have transformed image generation by allowing for the creation of high-quality synthetic images that mimic real-world characteristics.

The **primary goal** of our project was to train a DCGAN on a large dataset of human faces to produce lifelike synthetic faces that reflect diverse characteristics, including age, ethnicity, and gender. These generated faces are unique and do not correspond to any specific real individuals.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives:
1. **Develop a Basic DCGAN Model**: Establish an initial GAN framework that generates human faces.
2. **Generate Diverse, Realistic Faces**: Ensure a variety of outputs representing different demographics.

### Secondary Objectives:
1. **Model Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune the model by exploring different architectures and hyperparameters.
2. **Evaluation and Validation**: Use metrics like Inception Score (IS) and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) for quantitative assessment.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
   - **Datasets Used**: CelebA and FFHQ, which provide images of various demographics.
   - **Preprocessing Steps**: Normalizing, resizing, and augmenting images to enhance dataset diversity.

### 2. Model Architecture
   - **Generator**: Uses transposed convolutional layers to produce images from random noise. The final layer uses Tanh activation for pixel values.
   - **Discriminator**: Employs convolutional layers to classify images as real or generated, using Sigmoid activation for probability scoring.

### 3. Training Process
   - **Adversarial Training**: The generator and discriminator train in a zero-sum competition to improve the quality of generated images.
   - **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss for both networks, tracking convergence for performance adjustments.

### 4. Model Evaluation
   - **Visual Inspection**: Periodic image samples to assess realism and diversity.
   - **Quantitative Metrics**: IS and FID used to evaluate output quality against real images.
